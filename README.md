## General Info

I'm building an application that will help presentors, narrators, or anyone with a speaking position to pronounce names. This isn't just limited to names, thus can be used with concepts as well, mainly science terms. Users will be able to create collections for names of a group of graduates, competetion memebers, groups of concepts that relate to each other, etc. They will then be able to reference that collection or specific word later on when needed.
