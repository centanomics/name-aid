# [Concept Name]

## Application Definition Statement

I'm building an application that will help presentors, narrators, or anyone with a speaking position to pronounce names. This isn't just limited to names, thus can be used with concepts as well, mainly science terms. Users will be able to create collections for names of a group of graduates, competetion memebers, groups of concepts that relate to each other, etc. They will then be able to reference that collection or specific word later on when needed.

## Target Market

The ideal user would be someone who speaks publicly on a regulular basis. [This website](https://learn.org/articles/What_Degree_Do_I_Need_to_be_a_Professional_Public_Speaker.html) mentions that relevant degrees are Business communication, Multimedia Journalism, and many others. As an example, a sports announcer [makes an average of \$41,800](https://www.sports-management-degrees.com/faq/how-much-does-a-broadcast-sports-announcer-make/) per year.

Secondary markets could include places like school competitions where speakers will need to know names of the competitors (overlaps with primary market), and in the case of a science fair, a few key terms in a project.

## User Profile

-world cup commentator

-public speaker who announces for competitions

-teacher

## Use Cases

A teacher creates collections of names for her students each school year to not mispronounce the names.

A World cup commentator creates a collection of the players competing

A narrator for a science documentary makes a collection of the terms used in the program so he doesn't fumble his words while speaking.

## Problem Statement

_In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research._

Mispronouncing names can be seen as disrespectful by those people. In a immigrants case, it could be painful and make them decide on [choosing a more americanized name](http://neatoday.org/2016/09/01/pronouncing-students-names/) to avoid mispronounciations.

## Pain Points

_Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations._

Avoiding interrupting your flow by mispronouncing their names multiple times or having trouble mispronouncing names live.

## Solution Statement

_How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?_

Allows the users to save terms/names to a collection, then be able to reference that collection later. Able to quickly reference the collections they've created

## Competition

_What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own._

- [google translate](https://translate.google.com/) - allows for you to choose the language of the name and in most cases, shows pronunciation.

## Key Features

_Define key features intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key features should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points. More generic features like User Authentication should not be defined here._

-creating and naming a collection (e.g. 1st period)
-adding names to that collection
-being able to share that collection to others who may need it
-edit names in the collection as needed
