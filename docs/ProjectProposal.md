# [Concept Name]

## Application Definition Statement

I'm building an application that will help presentors, narrators, or anyone with a speaking position to pronounce names. This isn't just limited to names, thus can be used with concepts as well, mainly science terms. Users will be able to create collections for names of a group of graduates, competetion memebers, groups of concepts that relate to each other, etc. They will then be able to reference that collection or specific word later on when needed.

## Target Market

The ideal user would be someone who speaks publicly on a regulular basis. [This website](https://learn.org/articles/What_Degree_Do_I_Need_to_be_a_Professional_Public_Speaker.html) mentions that relevant degrees are Business communication, Multimedia Journalism, and many others. As an example, a sports announcer [makes an average of \$41,800](https://www.sports-management-degrees.com/faq/how-much-does-a-broadcast-sports-announcer-make/) per year.

Secondary markets could include places like school competitions where speakers will need to know names of the competitors (overlaps with primary market), and in the case of a science fair, a few key terms in a project.

## User Profile

_User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market._

## Use Cases

_Defining a typical use case or scenario that a user would be interacting with your application provides a fixed path of interaction that you can refine your user’s experience around. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout does requiring them to clicking 10+ times make sense while they are impatiently trying to start their exercise regimen? Use cases help to think through how your application will commonly be used._

_Use Cases will help to drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. Regularly testing as if you were a user following a use case throughout the project development lifecycle will provide valuable insight into how your application is addressing the needs of the user and allow you to correct missteps early._

## Problem Statement

_In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research._

## Pain Points

_Explain your audience’s pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations._

## Solution Statement

_How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from other’s attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?_

## Competition

_What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own._

## Key Features

_Define key features intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key features should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points. More generic features like User Authentication should not be defined here._
