# Marketing Plan

Clarity should be the focus. To that end, creating visuals/charts may communicate information better than blocks of text.

## Define Marketing Goals and Objectives

For this site, a few of the marketing goals that were chosen include getting a 10% increase in traffic per month. High engagement rates would be a good goal as well. More specifically, getting at least 100 more people to innteract with our posts on social media. A long term goal is to get more brand awareness, which includes going to a few local education conferences to show off my product.

## Identify Marketing Methods

- word of mouth marketing
	- passing of information from person to person
	- This would be done at confereces for educators, meaning the only cost would be for attending those conferences. This highest price I've seen is 990 dollars.
	- This would also include business cards to share at conferences
- diversity marketing
	- changing marketing style based on audiences your focusing on.
	- Initially this is going to consist of
- content marketing
	- This would include making blogs related to phonetics.
	- have either monthly or weekly blog posts about cool intricacies of the english
- niche marketing
	- Focusing specifically on educators for the time being
	- this goes along with word of mouth marketing as I can go to conferences to market my product
- affinity marketing
	- working with education related brands
	- I think that starting out this isn't the best option for marketing because of the target market that I want to focus on. Later down the line, once my site grows this will definitely be an option though
- seasonal marketing
	- plan marketing strategies around a month or two before school starts, at least for the US.
	- I could simple ask schools locally to come to talk to teachers about the application and how it can help them.
- email marketing
	- see content marketing
- article marketing
	- see content marketing
- community marketing
	- Supporting local teams, like a schools science club for example.


## Selected Marketing Methods

- word of mouth
- content
- seasonal
- community

Costs

- Local education conference: [FAME - 300 dollars for non member tickets](http://www.fame-conference.com/Register)
	- setting aside 1k at most for conferences. The most expensive tickets that I found went for 990 dollars. Of course, I'm not going to aim for the highest prices every time, but it makes sense to set aside that much per quarter to go to 1-2 conferences per quarter.
- business cards: [33 dollars for 1000 cards](https://www.vistaprint.com/business-cards/standard)
	- setting aside 33 dollars per for business cards per month. Not only will I be trying to share them at confernces I go too, but via word of mouth, I can go ahead and give them a business card if they're interested
- content writer for blogs or emails: [Content writer - 40 dollars average](https://www.upwork.com/hiring/marketing/cost-hire-content-writer/)
	- setting aside 4000 dollars per quarter for a content writer. Since I'm charging them per hour, I don't want to articles to come out too often, so 4k should be right amount based on how much they charge per hour
- For now, I will probably handle the social media on my own. Unless I start advertising my posts, managing socials doesn't cost anything. If I decide to later down the line though, it will cost [$1.35 per engagement](https://thrivehive.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-advertise-on-twitter/) to promote a tweet. Starting out, I can have about 1k per month to go towards that

## Budget

- In total, based on the the 4 main methods that I'm using to market my site, It will cost a little more than 32 thousand dollars yearly for marketing purposes. Of course starting out, I won't be doing all of them starting out, but as my brand grows, I can branch out to the other methods I've defined.
