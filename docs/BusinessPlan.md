## Name Aid will make money by...

I think the best way to help Name aid make money is by making it a freemium service. As an example, users would have access to creating up to 10 collections. If they wanted more access, then they would pay a one time fee of 4.99 allowing for them to create essentially an infinite number of collections. Since this is aimed at people like sports casters or teachers thats why I decided to make it a freemium service.

## My competitors

- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) - In the [docs](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/) for Google translate api they offer around 300 USD in credits to use the api for free. After that it costs around 20 dollars per one million characters. Some applications use their api to translate their website into other languages. Reviews of the api are mostly good, it has a rating of 3.7.

- [Pronounce Names](https://www.pronouncenames.com/) - the main way Pronoince names make money is by having sponsors, which in their case is 360 biometrics. They also link to their youtube channel which is a way to earn income as well. They also have an advertise with us page, which allows advertisers to add simple messages that will be used. There is also a link to refer the website to a friend, which helps the previous three ways mentioned.

- [toIPA](https://tophonetics.com/) - The main way toIPA earns money is through advertisements. They also have mobile applications on the Google play store and app store that sell for 1.99 and 3.99 each, making it another income source. Users gave both applications a score of 3.5 and 4.3 respectively, meaning users are not dissapointed with the apps, but do want more for their buck.

## Projected income

For my primary audience, commentators and sports casters, they are willing to spend a but more on an application. Since their [average salary](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Sportscaster/Salary) is 60k USD, they can afford to spend more on an application. Teachers in the us have an [average salary](http://money.com/money/5287489/average-teacher-salary-by-state/) of less than 54k in a majority of states, they won't want to spend too much an an application like this.  If there are [580,000](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/analysis/2005-sa02.asp) new teachers each year and [40,020](https://www.sports-management-degrees.com/job-profiles/sports-broadcaster/). If 10% of this total bought the application to use its full features, then the projected income would be 309389.98.

# Marketing

## Elevator Pitch

What Name Aid wants to accomplish is to help teachers, commentators, or anyone similar help pronounce a group of names they have trouble with. The goal of the app is to help avoid the awkwardness that comes with pronouncing someone's name for the first time. Users will be able to create collections for their class or for sports teams. They can then reference this collection later on and even share it to acquaintances who need help pronouncing names as well. Also, this isn't limited to just names, users can also use it for help with complicated English terms as well.
