# [Marketing Plan]

Clarity should be the focus. To that end, creating visuals/charts may communicate information better than blocks of text.

## Define Marketing Goals and Objectives

*Describe the marketing goals and objectives of your site. Be specific but set goals that support the site's goals and objectives. Make a list of the specific goals so you can connect them to marketing methods.*

## Identify Marketing Methods

*Identify the various marketing methods, both online and offline, that may help your site meet the goals set. Research them and document which of your goals they may help with, any costs associated with them, and provide examples of other's that have used the method successfully.*

*Not all methods you identify may be effective for your needs. Filtering out methods that may not be right for your project is part of this process. Mark the methods you don't believe will work and explain why.*

## Selected Marketing Methods

*List each of the methods you identified as appropriate for your project and explain why (may be explained above) and the expected costs associated with the method.*

*Costs should be based on the vendor's billing method, specific details, for example, .10 cents per click, or $10 per 100 business cards.*

## Budget

*Based on the methods selected and their costs, build a budget for implementing your marketing methods. How much do you expect to spend for how much of the service or product? Is this daily, weekly, monthly?*

*This should indicate your specific total costs, itemized with per-unit cost, number of units and totals. You may specify the total is daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or identify the itemized cost for the entire defined period you will use that method. Example: 100 Business Cards per month at $10 for 6 months. Total 600 cards @ $60.*

*The use of a chart or spreadsheet may help in displaying this information.*

## Schedule

*Create a schedule for rolling out the various marketing methods you intend to use. Identify if a specific item runs continuously, or is every week, month, or year.  Identify the start and stop dates for each method. You may assume your Capstone project has not launched and include the lead-up to launch in your marketing schedule. What methods might you implement prior to launch, at launch and after? Will their be a phase 2 or additional features rolled out you will need to market?*

*A bar chart may be an effective method of communicating the schedule.*
