# Analytics Plan

Clarity should be the focus. To that end, creating visuals/charts may communicate information better than blocks of text.

## Define Goals and Objectives

*Describe the goals and objectives of your site. Be specific but set goals for the business of the site. Make a list of the specific goals so you can connect tool features to the goal they measure.*

The main goal for my site is for it to gain as many users as possible. Another goal is to have users that come from a variety of places. This means that success for this site will be measured by user count per location. Social shares and having a low bounce rate will also help measure that.

## Analytics User Profile

*Research the skill-level of the person or persons that will be responsible for monitoring the site's analytics and will need to use the tool. Explain their needs and how this will influence the selection of an Analytics tool.*

A few characteristics of the person that will be responsible for the sites analytics include:

- A Technophile
- Has interests in maintaining social media
- Has a minimal understanding in statistics

As long as the person that will monitor my site's analytics has less than an idea knowledge in statistics they should be fine. This does mean though that this person will need some guidance outside of the basic information that you get. This has influence on the analytics tool that I'm going to choose because I'll be looking for one that will be a bit user friendly.

## Features Analysis

*Describe the various analytics tools you considered. Research the features and how they match up to your goals and objectives. Using a Feature Analysis grid, show the tools, their features, costs, and how they meet your needs.*

I only looked a few analytics tools, and I had Google analytics as a baseline. The two tools that interested me the most are Clicky and AWStats. AWStats is free, while Clicky costs 9.99 per month per 1 million views. Clicky interested me because they include twitter analytics, which "monitors and summarizes conversations about your web site or other topics of interest." On the other hand, AWStats interests me because of their entry and exit pages, which has entry and exit pages, which I find helpful for my site.

*Can two tools provide the required information in an easy to understand manner better than a single, all-inclusive tool that may add complexity or overwhelm a novice analytics user? Tool selection may consist of more than one tool.*

|Tools|Real Time|Heatmaps|Twitter Analytics|Entry and exit pages|Filtering and segmentation|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Google Analytics|x|   |   |   |x|
|Clicky|x|x|x|   |x|
|AWStats|x|   |   |x|x|

## Tool Selection

*Based on the information and research above, identify the tool you selected and the reasons behind the selection. How will this tool best provide the data required in a format the user can understand? Detail the features that drove the selection and what goal or objective it helps measure.*

In the end, the tool that would work best for my site is Clicky. Despite the main dashboard being a bit overwhelming, what the tool offers vastly outweighs that negative. I didn't choose AWStats, because the heatmaps and seeing what site the users click on solves the same thing.

## Implementation Plan

*Describe the method the selected tool will be implemented into your Capstone project. Also, describe any tool configuration needed to display the data required and which goal or objective it applies to. *

Since this is essentially a custom site. I will be following the instructions for the custom website on [this page](https://clicky.com/help/apps-plugins#website). I will be adding the tracking code to the html manually (which is in the public folder). The tracking code is an anchor tag which is put into a tag that only appears once on the page, like a header or footer, or within the body tag itself. Since I am using react. I can simply put the tracking code inside of the body tag, since it will only render once.

## Training and Documentation

*Develop a training plan for the person/people that will be using the analytics tool to measure success. This plan should be bullet points listing the specific topics to be covered.*

*Create a training/instruction manual that walks the analytics user through the steps to log-in, navigate, pull the required information and, if necessary, how to utilize the data to measure against specific goals.*
