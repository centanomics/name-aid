# [Analytics Plan]

Clarity should be the focus. To that end, creating visuals/charts may communicate information better than blocks of text.

## Define Goals and Objectives

*Describe the goals and objectives of your site. Be specific but set goals for the business of the site. Make a list of the specific goals so you can connect tool features to the goal they measure.*

## Analytics User Profile

*Research the skill-level of the person or persons that will be responsible for monitoring the site's analytics and will need to use the tool. Explain their needs and how this will influence the selection of an Analytics tool.*

## Features Analysis

*Describe the various analytics tools you considered. Research the features and how they match up to your goals and objectives. Using a Feature Analysis grid, show the tools, their features, costs, and how they meet your needs.*

*Can two tools provide the required information in an easy to understand manner better than a single, all-inclusive tool that may add complexity or overwhelm a novice analytics user? Tool selection may consist of more than one tool.*

## Tool Selection

*Based on the information and research above, identify the tool you selected and the reasons behind the selection. How will this tool best provide the data required in a format the user can understand? Detail the features that drove the selection and what goal or objective it helps measure.*

## Implementation Plan

*Describe the method the selected tool will be implemented into your Capstone project. Also, describe any tool configuration needed to display the data required and which goal or objective it applies to. *

## Training and Documentation

*Develop a training plan for the person/people that will be using the analytics tool to measure success. This plan should be bullet points listing the specific topics to be covered.*

*Create a training/instruction manual that walks the analytics user through the steps to log-in, navigate, pull the required information and, if necessary, how to utilize the data to measure against specific goals.*

*This manual/document may be a Google Doc, Word or PDF document.  Provide a link in this document to your final training manual.
